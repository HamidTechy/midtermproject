          that had embraced Islam in the seventeenth century, 
          was born and settled in Sialkot. 
          After a traditional education in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu, 
          he was exposed to a liberal education 
          that defined the contours of his thought and 
          his poetry during the entire period of his life.

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-center">
              Syed Amanullah Meer Taqi was the only son of a Sufi saint, 
              Meer Muttaqi. When Meer was a little child, 
              his father looking at his face used to say what this fire is 
              which is burning within your heart that is reflecting on your face. 
              Living in an atmosphere of Sufism at a very young age had profound effect on Meer. 
              He did not have much desire for worldly things. 
              This is a philosophy reflected by Meer in most of his works. 
              A lot about Meer's life has been figured out by his autobiographical writing called Zikr-e-Mir. 
              To know more about Meer, continue to read this insightful biography on him.

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-center">
              Ghalib is the poetical surname of Asadullah Khan, 
              the greatest poet of Urdu. He is the last of the great Delhi poets, 
              and is the first of the great modern poets. He stands between two worlds. 
              Trained in classical Persian and mystic philosophy, 
              he also profited from the western influences 
              and the spirit of Indian Renaissance. “He employed ‘heterogeneous ideas’ 
              and ‘yoked them together with voilence’ like the English Metaphysical poets. 
              He towers above the hundreds and hundreds of Urdu poets like a ‘victor’ (Ghalib), 
              as his pseudonym means.

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-center">
              Abul Hasan Yaminuddin, better known as Amir Khusrau (1252-1325) 
              after being decorated with the title of Emir by one of his patrons, 
              had the unique distinction of being a soldier, courtier, sufi, poet, litterateur, 
              and music maestro. Although the details of his life 
              and works remain uncertain to a considerable extent, 
              we have much that help us construct his figure in various avatars that he richly represented.
               It has been generally agreed upon that after suffering the onslaughts of Chengez Khan,
                his father, a Turk chieftain, migrated to India during the reign of Shamsuddin Altamsh
                 who gave him a high position in his army. 
              Khusrau was born in Patiali in Etah district of Uttar Pradesh where his father had settled.
